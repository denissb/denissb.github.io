On a bored afternoon I decided it would be cool to learn how to build an Angular2 application using [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) with state tracking and devtool integration. A working example can be found on github for both [redux](https://github.com/spawnius/angular2-todo/tree/redux) and [basic](https://github.com/spawnius/angular2-todo) implementations.

Immutability and uni-directional flow can help us build more robust, scalable and performant front-end applications. Not to mention it's cool to be able to track the state of your application and manipulate it on demand.

A possible improvement would be to implement a branch that is more compliant with [RFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming).
